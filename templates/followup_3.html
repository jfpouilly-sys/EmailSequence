  <p>Dear {title} {last_name},</p>

  <p>This will be my final email, as I don't want to overwhelm your inbox.</p>

  <p>I remain interested in exploring how ISIT could partner with {company}, and the door
  is always open should you wish to connect in the future.</p>

  <p>If now isn't the right time, I completely understand and wish you all the best with
  your current initiatives.</p>

  <p>Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>

  <p>Best regards,<br>
