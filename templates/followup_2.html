  <p>Dear {title} {last_name},</p>

  <p>I hope this email finds you well. I wanted to reach out once more regarding the
  partnership opportunity I mentioned in my previous messages.</p>

  <p>I recognize timing is important, and if this isn't the right time for {company},
  I completely understand. However, I'd hate to miss the chance to connect if there is interest.</p>

  <p>If you'd like to learn more, I'm happy to send additional information or schedule
  a brief call at your convenience.</p>

  <p>Best regards,<br>
  {sender_name}</p>
